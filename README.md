2. **Decimal Point**: Use the '.' button to enter a decimal point for floating-point numbers.
3. **Arithmetic Operations**: Click on the '+', '-', '×', and '÷' buttons to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively.
4. **Logical Operations**: Use the 'OR', 'AND', and 'NOT' buttons to perform bitwise logical operations.
5. **Clear and Delete**: Press the 'CLR' button to clear the input field and 'Backspace' to delete the last entered character.
6. **Equals (=)**: Click the '=' button to compute the result of the current expression.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Java AWT**: For event handling and drawing basic graphical elements.
